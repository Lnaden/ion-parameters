These are the scripts I used on our cluster to run GROMACS simulations and carry out all the re-evaluation of energies.

Each of these scripts/files is invoked by the siterate\_parameters.py script in the main repo, or is manipulated by the scripts here to create input files for SLURM and GROMACS.

These files will likely not work as-is on your systems, but have been included in the repo you can see the workflow.
