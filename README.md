ion-parameters
==============

This houses the main scripts I use for creating the iterative ion parametrization.

Primary script is iterate\_params.py (for PBS job handling on UVa Fir Custer) or siterate\_params.py (for SLURM job handling on UVa Rivanna Cluster)

Script is designed to configure and execute jobs on the clusters from remote computer with SSH Key access.
